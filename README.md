Client Scenario Overview:
Community FC, under the dynamic leadership of the owner, has established itself as a cornerstone of local soccer culture, offering extensive programs that cater to various age groups, skill levels, and interests. The club aims to nurture talent, promote physical well-being, and foster a sense of community through soccer. Its offerings include many levels of teams, training camps, weekend matches, and special events.

The club's facilities are top-notch, featuring multiple soccer fields, a clubhouse with locker rooms, a gym, and a merchandise shop. Community FC prides itself on its inclusive environment, welcoming members from various backgrounds to participate in its programs.

Project Problem:
At Community FC, our primary challenge revolves around the complex coordination needed to manage our soccer club efficiently. From member management and team organization to league administration, facility scheduling, financial transactions, and merchandise sales, many interconnected elements require seamless integration.

Coordinating member profiles, team assignments, league participation, facility bookings, financial transactions, and merchandise inventory demands meticulous attention to detail and effective communication among staff, coaches, players, and parents.

To tackle this challenge, we require a relational database system that can streamline these processes, providing real-time visibility into club operations and facilitating smooth coordination across all facets of our organization. This solution will enable us to enhance member experiences, optimize resource utilization, and uphold Community FC's commitment to excellence in our local soccer community.
